K-Means.ipynb
Unsupervised clustering using K-Means + visualization & elbow method.

LINEAR REG -1.ipynb
Simple & Multiple Linear Regression models.

SimpleImputer.ipynb
Handling missing values using sklearn imputers (mean, median, most frequent).

🔹 2. Deep Learning Notebooks

Deep Learning ANN.ipynb
Building and training a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras.

MNIST CNN.ipynb
Convolutional Neural Network for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

cifer10 CNN.ipynb
CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

🔹 3. Datasets Included

Salary Data.csv – used for Regression tasks

fish_data.csv – used for classification/regression practice

diabetes2.csv – medical dataset for prediction tasks

Any other dataset used inside notebooks is included for reproducibility.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Practice core ML algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering).

Build Deep Learning foundations with ANN and CNN models.

Improve preprocessing skills (missing values, normalization, splitting data).

Create a clean portfolio of ML/DL notebooks for future reference.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https:https://github.com/mariam-maged-12/Adv-AI.git


Open .ipynb notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code.

Install required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow


Run the cells in order.

📌 Notes

Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations and outputs.

Datasets are included for quick testing and reproducibility.

More tasks will be added as I continue learning.
